# Friend List Access Program

This program is a fun application designed to check whether you are "worthy" to enter a palace by verifying your name against a predefined friend list.

---

## Purpose

- The program represents a group of **10 close friends** who went on a memorable trip together.
- They created this system as a gesture to celebrate their **friendship and memories**.
- The palace belongs to one of the friends, **Maahi**, and only those on the **friend list** are allowed to enter.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Prompt for Name
- The program asks the user to type their name.

### 2. Verify the Name
- The name entered by the user is compared against the **predefined friend list**.

### 3. Decision
- **If the name matches**:
  - A personalized message is displayed for each friend.
  - Example: “Welcome, you can enter the palace.”

- **If the name doesn't match**:
  - A warning message is shown.
  - Example: “Sorry, you are a trespasser. Please contact my manager.”
